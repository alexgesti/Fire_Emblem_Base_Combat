# How to play:

- NOTE. You need a "Game Master" to play and our "Rol Story".
- In your turn, you need to select 1 unit and try to kill the enemy units. 
- You can move all the units in your turn.
- All movement is in the X and Y axis.
- If you cancel your move, you will return to your old position and you can move the unit again.
- All the units must move or do an action to change turns.
- When live of a unit drops to 0, he will die.
- You have 3 types of units:
	- Tank: can move 3 spaces.
	- Strategist: can move 8 spaces.
